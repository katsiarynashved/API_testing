# API testing
My education program encompassed studying API testing. I needed to practice REST and SOAP using such softwares as Postman and SOAP UI. Here you can see the results of my working in Postman.

## Pet Store 🐈
Main task was to test API of Pet store site (link to the documentation in Swagger:  https://petstore.swagger.io) The requirments were simplified that's why from time to time they did not accord with common sense. All the fields with string format had no validation. So I wrote positive requests to check whether API works as it should be and negative tests that were declared in the documentation to see the behavior of the system.  
<br>🐞 During the testing I found a lot of bugs which I'll add to the repository "Bug-reports" soon.
